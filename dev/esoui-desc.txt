[QUOTE][COLOR="Red"]This update will reset your SavedVariable (Your custom made syncs for Clock - TST)[/COLOR][/QUOTE]
[size=4]
With Update 7 a new background feature was added. The [i]Clock - TST[/i] never looked that good before. Check it out.
Additional to that and a few bug fixes, you can now have your real time next to the Tamriel time instead of beneath.

You can use this addon together with [url=http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info642-HarvensDwemerClock.html][color=Orange]Harven's Dwemer Clock[/color][/url] to get the ingame Time as a fantastic looking, animated clock. Install both addons then right-click on the Dwemer Clock and click "Use Tamriel Standard Time Clock" option. You can change the size of the Dwemer Clock by clicking on it (left mouse button) and then scrolling with your mouse wheel over the Clock.

Follow the Clock on [url=http://bit.ly/clockTSTGitSource]GitHub[/url] to always get the latest beta/alpha Version (caution: unstable)
I will release every stable build here as soon as possible!
If you like an offline desktop application of the Clock to see the current time in Tamriel where ever a PC is, search no further and look [url=http://bit.ly/clockGitJApp]here[/url] (still an alpha Version)

[size=5][b][color=Teal]Features[/color][/b][/size]
[size=4]
This AddOn will show you the current time in [i]Tamriel[/i].
It is displayed on the Interface wherever you want it to be - [b][color=Orange]completely movable[/color][/b].
You are also able to [b][color=orange]set the size, font and style of the clock[/color][/b] to your liking.

[u]The time in Tamriel is not a fact.[/u]

There is not function in the API which gets us the length back.
Many people right now are trying to figure out how long a day is.
Zenimax Online stated in their FAQ that the time is a bit less than 5h, but after many tests I am sure it is 5,83h long.
If you agree with me or not is up to you.
You are able to [b][color=orange]customize the length of the day[/color][/b] easily in the [i]Clock - TST[/i] settings.
This can be done to a precision of seconds.

The time could be off after a maintenance or something else.
With the settings menu or commands you can [b][color=orange]choose one out of four times to synchronize the clock[/color][/b].
For example you see the sun right under your South needle of the compass. 
You are sure that it is noon right now. 
No problem: Just write /cl noon in the chat or use the "Noon is now!" button in the settings to sync your clock.

The best way to sync your Clock is to set the clock to noon at noon and wait a day or more (ingame).
Then set your time (at noon again) so that your clock shows exactly 12:00.
When this is done you should have a perfectly synced clock
Noon is best because you can see the sun and you have a compass 
So just wait until the sun is right under you South sign at you compass.

Right now, the settings and the [color=Orange][b]Clock is localized in English and German[/b][/color].
[/size]
[size=4]
If you are from the US or any other country which uses a 12-hour clock, you are able to change the clock to that format too. You can even hide the am/pm signs.
Of course you can [b][color=orange]use the formats: 12h or 24h[/color][/b] wherever you are from.
You can also [b][color=orange]hide the 0 before a single number[/color][/b]: 01:12 -> 1:12.

I personally love to see the seconds pass by. It is fun to see if they reach the zero or step over it (because of the game to real time ratio). It is like the screensaver of a DVD player... you have to watch for some reason.
If they distract you to much - like me - or you just don't want to see them, just disable them.
You can [b][color=orange]disable to show seconds[/color][/b] in the settings menu.

You can let the Clock AddOn [b][color=Orange]show you the current moon phase and the time to the next one[/color][/b].
This feature is like the time not based on a fact but on a adjustable algorithm.
After many month of studding it I am sure one cycle is 30 Tamriel days long, but you can still change the length of the different phases.
You can [color=orange][b]customize the length of a moon phase[/b][/color] at the settings menu.

Clock does not stop there. 
You can also let the Clock show you the [b][color=Orange]current lore date on your screen[/color][/b] either as a real calculated date or a fake one representing the current real date as a lore date.

The look of the [b][color=Orange]time and date are fully customizable[/color][/b]. 
Write a String like this in the text field in the settings:
[i]_DDD, _D day of _MMM _YY _hh:_mm:_ss[/i]

It will return you a date looking like this:
[i]Fredas, 4th day of First Seed 2E 582 07:09:08[/i]
[/size]
[size=4]
If you want the Clock will also [b][color=Orange]show you the current real date and time[/color][/b] as customizable as the lore time and date.
[/size]
[size=4]
[b]TL;DR[/b]
[b][color=Orange]Clock - TST gives you a fully customizable lore- (and real-) date and time system with moon cycle integration.[/color][/b]
